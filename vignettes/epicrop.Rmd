## Introduction to _epicrop_

_epicrop_ provides an R package of the 'EPIRICE' model as described in Savary _et al._ 2012.
Default values derived from the literature suitable for modelling unmanaged disease intensity of five rice diseases, bacterial blight (`predict_bacterial_blight()`); brown spot (`predict_brown_spot()`); leaf blast (`predict_leaf_blast()`); sheath blight (`predict_sheath_blight()`) and tungro (`predict_tungro()`) are provided.
The model uses daily weather data to estimate disease intensity.
A function, `get_wth()`, is provided to simplify downloading weather data via the [_nasapower_](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nasapower) package (Sparks 2018, Sparks 2020) and predict disease intensity of five rice diseases using a generic SEIR model (Zadoks 1971) function, `SEIR()`.

Using the package functions is designed to be straightforward for modelling rice disease risks, but flexible enough to accommodate other pathosystems using the `SEIR()` function.
If you are interested in modelling other pathosystems, please refer to Savary _et al._ 2012 for the development of the parameters that were used for the rice diseases as derived from the existing literature and are implemented in the individual disease model functions.

### Getting started

Load the library.


```r
library("epicrop")
```

### Get weather data

The most simple way to use the model is to download weather data from NASA POWER using `get_wth()`, which provides the data in a format suitable for use in the model and is freely available.
See the help file for `naspower::get_power()` for more details of this functionality and details on the data (Sparks 2018, Sparks 2020).


```r
# Fetch weather for year 2000 season at the IRRI Zeigler Experiment Station
wth <- get_wth(
  lonlat = c(121.25562, 14.6774),
  dates = c("2000-01-01", "2000-12-31")
)
```

```
## Error: Something went wrong with the query, no data were returned. Please see <https://power.larc.nasa.gov> for potential server issues.
```

```r
wth
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'wth' not found
```

### Predict bacterial blight

All of the `predict_()` family of functions work in exactly the same manner.
You provide them with weather data and an emergence date, that falls within the weather data provided, and they will return a data frame of disease intensity over the season and other values associated with the model.
See the help file for `SEIR()` for more on the values returned.


```r
# Predict bacterial blight intensity for the year 2000 wet season at IRRI
bb_wet <- predict_bacterial_blight(wth, emergence = "2000-07-01")
```

```
## Error in SEIR(wth = wth, emergence = emergence, onset = 20L, duration = 120L, : object 'wth' not found
```


```r
summary(bb_wet)
```

```
## Error in summary(bb_wet): object 'bb_wet' not found
```

## Plotting using _ggplot2_

The data are in a wide format by default and need to be converted to long format for use in _ggplot2_ if you wish to plot more than one variable at a time.


```r
library("ggplot2")
library("tidyr")
```

### Wet season sites

The model records the number of sites for each bin daily; this can be graphed as follows.


```r
dat <- pivot_longer(
  bb_wet,
  cols = c("diseased", "removed", "latent", "infectious"),
  names_to = "site",
  values_to = "value"
)
```

```
## Error in pivot_longer(bb_wet, cols = c("diseased", "removed", "latent", : object 'bb_wet' not found
```

```r
ggplot(data = dat,
       aes(
         x = dates,
         y = value,
         shape = site,
         linetype = site
       )) +
  labs(y = "Sites",
       x = "Date") +
  geom_line(aes(group = site, colour = site)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = site)) +
  theme_classic()
```

```
## Error in ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = dates, y = value, shape = site, linetype = site)): object 'dat' not found
```

### Wet season intensity

Plotting intensity over time does not require any data manipulation.


```r
ggplot(data = bb_wet,
       aes(x = dates,
           y = intensity * 100)) +
  labs(y = "Intensity (%)",
       x = "Date") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```

```
## Error in ggplot(data = bb_wet, aes(x = dates, y = intensity * 100)): object 'bb_wet' not found
```

## Comparing epidemics

The most common way to compare disease epidemics in botanical epidemiology is to use the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) (Shaner and Finney 1977).
The AUDPC value for a given simulated season is returned as a part of the output from any of the disease simulations offered in _epicrop_.
You can find the value in the `AUDPC` column.
We can compare the dry season with the wet season by looking at the AUDPC values for both seasons.


```r
bb_dry <- predict_bacterial_blight(wth = wth, emergence = "2000-01-05")
```

```
## Error in SEIR(wth = wth, emergence = emergence, onset = 20L, duration = 120L, : object 'wth' not found
```

```r
summary(bb_dry)
```

```
## Error in summary(bb_dry): object 'bb_dry' not found
```

### Dry season intensity

Check the disease progress curve for the dry season.


```r
ggplot(data = bb_dry,
       aes(x = dates,
           y = intensity * 100)) +
  labs(y = "Intensity (%)",
       x = "Date") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```

```
## Error in ggplot(data = bb_dry, aes(x = dates, y = intensity * 100)): object 'bb_dry' not found
```

As the AUDPC value is found in the `AUDPC` column and is repeated for every row of the `data.table` so we only need to access the first row.
We can easily do this by calling the column using the `$` operator and `[]` to select an index value, in this case the first row of the `data.table`.
Optionally if you wished to used _dplyr_ you could use the `dplyr::distinct()` function, which is demonstrated in the "Mapping Simulations" vignette.


```r
# Dry season
bb_dry$AUDPC[1]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'bb_dry' not found
```

```r
# Wet season
bb_wet$AUDPC[1]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'bb_wet' not found
```
